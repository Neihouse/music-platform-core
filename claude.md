## Recent Development Work

### Code Review Feedback & Improvements (July 2025)

#### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Unused Props Cleanup**: Removed unused `userId` prop from SettingsClient component
2. **Component Architecture**: Successfully broke down large SettingsClient component into smaller, maintainable pieces:
   - `EmailSection.tsx` - Handles email updates with validation
   - `PasswordSection.tsx` - Manages password changes
   - `DeleteAccountSection.tsx` - Account deletion with confirmation modal
3. **Shared Components**: Created reusable `ThemedCard` and `ThemedPaper` components to reduce styling duplication
4. **Hero Section Optimization**: Made top card more condensed by reducing spacing:
   - Reduced gap from "lg" to "md" in main stack
   - Reduced Group gaps from "lg"/"sm" to "md"/"xs"
   - Reduced padding in hero Paper from "xl" to "lg" on medium screens

#### üîÑ In Progress / Next Steps
1. **CSS Media Query Migration**: Replace inline `@media` queries with Mantine's responsive props
   - Current issue: Not all Mantine components support responsive object syntax
   - Need to use `sx` prop with `theme.fn.smallerThan/largerThan` for unsupported components
   - File: `/app/promoter/page.tsx` has ~14 inline media queries to convert

2. **Component Styling Consolidation**: 
   - Continue replacing Card components with ThemedCard in promoter page
   - Standardize all Paper components to use ThemedPaper
   - Create consistent color scheme variables

#### üìù Important Notes
- **CSS-in-JS Media Queries**: Use camelCase property names in media queries (e.g., `alignItems` not `align-items`)
- **Responsive Props Support**: Check Mantine component documentation before using responsive object syntax
- **Component Modularity**: Large components should be broken into logical sub-components for maintainability

### Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
üì± **[View Mobile Improvements Documentation](./MOBILE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**

Comprehensive mobile responsiveness enhancements have been implemented for the artist dashboard, focusing on:
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Progressive enhancement across breakpoints
- Touch-friendly interface optimizations
- Performance-optimized responsive layouts

Key improvements include:
- Responsive hero banner with optimized layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Progressive sizing for stats cards and interactive elements
- Mobile-optimized PromotersCard component
- Enhanced spacing and typography scaling
- Performance-optimized conditional rendering

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Mantine v8
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Styling**: Mantine CSS-in-JS with responsive style props
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow Mantine's design system patterns
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use proper error boundaries and loading states

### Responsive Design Patterns
- Utilize Mantine's responsive style props where supported
- Implement `hiddenFrom`/`visibleFrom` for conditional layouts
- Follow progressive enhancement principles
- Test across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Always reference [Mantine v8 Style Props Documentation](https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/) when updating styles**

### Style Development Guidelines
üìã **IMPORTANT**: Before making any style updates, always consult the official Mantine v8 documentation:
- üîó **Style Props Reference**: https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/
- üîó **Responsive Style Props**: https://mantine.dev/styles/responsive/#responsive-style-props
- Use responsive style props syntax: `{{ base: "sm", sm: "md", lg: "xl" }}`
- Understand which components support responsive props vs. requiring `hiddenFrom`/`visibleFrom`
- Follow Mantine's breakpoint system: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
- Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns
- **Prefer responsive style props over duplicate components** to reduce code duplication

#### CSS-in-JS Media Query Syntax
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: When using inline styles with media queries in React/Mantine:
- **INCORRECT**: `'@media (min-width: 48em)'` - Standard CSS syntax will cause errors
- **CORRECT**: `'@media (minWidth: 48em)'` - Use camelCase for CSS properties in objects
- **ALTERNATIVE**: Use Mantine's responsive style props instead of inline media queries when possible
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  // ‚ùå Wrong - will cause error
  style={{
    '@media (min-width: 48em)': {
      fontSize: '1.5rem'
    }
  }}
  
  // ‚úÖ Correct - camelCase property names
  style={{
    '@media (minWidth: 48em)': {
      fontSize: '1.5rem'
    }
  }}
  
  // ‚úÖ Better - use Mantine's responsive props when supported
  fz={{ base: "md", sm: "lg" }}
  ```

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize responsive style prop usage for better performance
- Use conditional rendering to avoid duplicate content
- Implement proper image optimization
- Follow Next.js performance best practices

### Database Query Guidelines
üîç **CRITICAL**: Always check existing queries before creating new ones:
- Use existing functions in `/db/queries/` directory
- Check `/db/queries/tracks.ts` for track-related queries like `getTracks()`, `getTopTracks()`, etc.
- Check `/db/queries/artists.ts` for artist-related queries  
- Check `/db/queries/promoters.ts` for promoter-related queries
- **DO NOT duplicate query logic** - reuse existing functions
- Transform data in action files (e.g., `/app/*/actions.ts`) rather than creating new queries
- Follow the pattern: Query functions return raw data, Action functions transform for UI consumption

### Code Duplication Prevention
‚ö†Ô∏è **AVOID DUPLICATE CODE**:
- Always check if functionality already exists before implementing
- Use existing components from `/components/shared/` like `MusicGrid`, `ArtistCard`, etc.
- Reuse existing query functions from `/db/queries/`
- Transform data in actions rather than creating new database queries
- Check this documentation and existing code patterns before starting new features

### Server Actions vs Server Functions
üèóÔ∏è **Important Architectural Pattern**:
- **Server Actions** (`'use server'`): Use for client-side form submissions and user interactions only
- **Server Functions**: Use for RSC (React Server Component) data fetching - no `'use server'` needed
- **File Organization**:
  - `/app/*/actions.ts` - Server actions for client interactions
  - `/app/*/data.ts` - Server functions for RSC data fetching
- **Client Components**: Cannot directly call server functions - data must be passed as props from RSC

### Data Flow Architecture 
üîÑ **Critical Data Flow Pattern**:
1. **RSC (Server Components)**: Fetch data using cached server functions from `/data.ts`
2. **Pass data as props**: Always pass server-fetched data to client components as props
3. **Client Components**: Never directly call server functions - receive data via props only
4. **Server Actions**: Only for user interactions (forms, buttons) - never for initial data fetching
5. **Parallel Fetching**: Use `Promise.all()` for multiple independent data sources

**Example Structure**:
```
/app/page/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx        # RSC - fetches data, passes to client
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions.ts      # Server actions for user interactions
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.ts         # Server functions for RSC data fetching
```

### File Organization & Caching Patterns
üìÅ **Cache Implementation Pattern**:
- Use Next.js `cache()` wrapper for data fetching functions in RSCs
- Create cached versions like `getCachedCityData`, `getCachedPopularCities` for performance
- Cache functions should handle errors gracefully and return fallback data
- Use `Promise.all()` for parallel data fetching when possible

Example pattern:
```typescript
const getCachedDataFunction = cache(async (params: string): Promise<DataType> => {
  try {
    const data = await serverFunction(params);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Return fallback data structure
    return { /* empty/default data */ };
  }
});
```
