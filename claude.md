## Key Features
- **Artist Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for artists to manage their profile, tracks, and promoter relationships
- **Promoter Dashboard**: Tools for promoters to discover and connect with artists
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with Supabase
- **Media Upload**: Support for track, avatar, and banner image uploads
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive design across all components

## Recent Development Work

### Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
ðŸ“± **[View Mobile Improvements Documentation](./MOBILE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**

Comprehensive mobile responsiveness enhancements have been implemented for the artist dashboard, focusing on:
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Progressive enhancement across breakpoints
- Touch-friendly interface optimizations
- Performance-optimized responsive layouts

Key improvements include:
- Responsive hero banner with optimized layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Progressive sizing for stats cards and interactive elements
- Mobile-optimized PromotersCard component
- Enhanced spacing and typography scaling
- Performance-optimized conditional rendering

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Mantine v8
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Styling**: Mantine CSS-in-JS with responsive style props
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow Mantine's design system patterns
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use proper error boundaries and loading states

### Responsive Design Patterns
- Utilize Mantine's responsive style props where supported
- Implement `hiddenFrom`/`visibleFrom` for conditional layouts
- Follow progressive enhancement principles
- Test across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Always reference [Mantine v8 Style Props Documentation](https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/) when updating styles**

### Style Development Guidelines
ðŸ“‹ **IMPORTANT**: Before making any style updates, always consult the official Mantine v8 Style Props documentation:
- ðŸ”— **Reference**: https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/
- Use responsive style props syntax: `{{ base: "sm", sm: "md", lg: "xl" }}`
- Understand which components support responsive props vs. requiring `hiddenFrom`/`visibleFrom`
- Follow Mantine's breakpoint system: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
- Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize responsive style prop usage for better performance
- Use conditional rendering to avoid duplicate content
- Implement proper image optimization
- Follow Next.js performance best practices
