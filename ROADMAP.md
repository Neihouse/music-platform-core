# Streamlined MVP Development with Supabase: A Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a detailed plan for building an MVP using Supabase, integrating key features like authentication, file storage, voting, and real-time ranking. By leveraging Supabase’s ecosystem, this approach ensures a streamlined and scalable development process.

## 1. Core Features Implementation

### User Authentication and Roles

- **Supabase Auth Setup:**
  - Enable email/password and social login options in the Supabase dashboard.
  - Extend the `public.users` table with custom metadata (e.g., `role` and `tenant_id`) for role-based access.
  - Use Supabase React hooks for seamless login, sign-up, and user role management.

- **Multi-Tenancy:**
  - Add a `tenant_id` field to all relevant tables for data isolation.
  - Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to enforce tenant-specific access.

### Track Upload

- Configure Supabase Storage for handling MP3/WAV file uploads.
- Develop a backend API in Next.js:
  - Generate signed URLs for secure file uploads using the Supabase SDK.
  - Store file metadata (e.g., title, genre, and file URL) in the `tracks` table.

### Voting System

- Implement RLS policies for vote restrictions:
  - Use a composite key (`user_id` and `track_id`) in the `votes` table to enforce a one-vote-per-user-per-track rule.
  - Restrict non-tenant users from accessing tracks outside their `tenant_id`.

### Track Listing and Ranking

- Use Supabase SQL queries to fetch and rank tracks by upvotes:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tracks
  WHERE tenant_id = 'your_tenant_id'
  ORDER BY upvotes DESC;
  ```
  2. Tech Stack Integration

Frontend
	•	Framework: Use Next.js for efficient SSR and CSR.
	•	Styling: Employ Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive design.

Backend
	•	Supabase replaces traditional backend servers with direct database queries and APIs.
	•	Use Supabase Functions for extending backend capabilities if required.

Database
	•	Schema Definitions:
	•	Users: id, email, role, tenant_id, created_at.
	•	Tracks: id, tenant_id, user_id, title, file_url, description, upvotes, created_at.
	•	Votes: id, tenant_id, user_id, track_id, created_at.
	•	Tenants: id, name, created_at.
	•	Row-Level Security (RLS):
	•	Enforce per-tenant data isolation.
	•	Restrict users to vote once per track using policies.

3. App Architecture

Frontend
	•	Use Supabase hooks (useAuth, useQuery, useMutation) for:
	•	Authentication flows.
	•	CRUD operations on tracks and votes.

Backend APIs
	•	Define REST-like endpoints directly tied to Supabase queries:
	•	/tracks: GET (list tracks), POST (upload tracks), PATCH/DELETE (manage tracks).
	•	/votes: POST (submit votes), GET (fetch vote counts).
	•	/users: Manage roles and metadata.

4. Build and Test

Frontend
	•	Build a user-friendly interface:
	•	Login/Sign-Up: Use Supabase hooks for authentication.
	•	Track Upload: Create forms with file upload and metadata input.
	•	Leaderboard: Display real-time track rankings using Supabase’s Realtime feature.

Backend
	•	Leverage Supabase for:
	•	Authentication and role management.
	•	Secure file storage and metadata linking.
	•	Managed PostgreSQL with robust RLS policies.

Testing
	•	Use tools like Postman or Insomnia for API testing.
	•	Validate RLS policies with Supabase’s built-in policy tester.

5. Deployment

Frontend
	•	Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel for seamless frontend hosting.

Backend and Database
	•	Supabase automatically handles backend deployment and database scaling.

6. Feedback Collection
	•	Integrate Supabase Analytics to monitor user engagement.
	•	Add in-app feedback forms to gather user insights on usability and performance.

Example Timeline

Week 1:
	•	Set up Supabase project, authentication, and database schemas.

Week 2:
	•	Implement track upload and storage functionality.

Week 3:
	•	Integrate frontend with Supabase Auth and database APIs.
	•	Test RLS policies.

Week 4:
	•	Deploy to Vercel, conduct thorough testing, and gather user feedback.
